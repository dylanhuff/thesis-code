	abstract = {This paper examines how progress in computer hardware and software may be applied to solve several serious problems in teaching computer science courses. It is concerned primarily with two such problems: 1) the lack of immediate reinforcement of computing concepts because of long delays between learning and practice, and 2) the difficulty instructors have motivating and explaining complex topics with currently available instruction tools and techniques. The paper first reviews the involvement of educational institutions in the evolution of computing. It then briefly surveys recent experiments in powerful personal computing. It describes an experiment in the application of new personal computer technology at Brown University which addresses the two educational problems noted above. It then outlines in detail the initial courseware for the environment. Finally, it discusses what changes in pedagogy will be needed to make such technology usable on a wide-scale.},

Constructing a new view for an algorithm typically takes dozens of design iterations, and can be very time-consuming. Our library eases the programmer's burden by providing high-level constructs for performing animations, and by offering an interpretive environment that eliminates the need for recompilations. This paper also illustrates ANIM3D's expressiveness by developing a 3D animation of Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm in just 70 lines of code.},

	title = {Algorithm {Animation}},
	abstract = {An algorithm animation environment is a means for exploring the dynamic behavior of algorithms that makes possible a fundamental improvement in the way we understand and think about them. It presents multiple graphical views of an algorithm in action, exposing properties that might otherwise be difficult to understand or even remain unnoticed. All views are updated simultaneously in real time as the algorithm executes, and each view is displayed in a separate window on the screen, whose location, size, and level of detail is interactively set by the end-user. A specialized interpreter controls execution in units that are specific to the algorithm, and allows multiple algorithms to be run simultaneously for comparisons. Programmers can implement new algorithms, graphical displays, and input generators and run them with existing libraries of such components.An important aspect of an algorithm animation environment, and one we believe is useful in any interactive environment, is the concept of a script: a record of an end-user's session that can be replayed. Scripts can be used both passively, as virtual videotapes, and actively, as an innovative communication medium: the viewer of a script can customize the videotape interactively, and can readily switch between passively viewing it and actively exploring its contents. Scripts are typically used as high-level macros, system tutors, and electronic textbooks and research notes. End-users can create scripts easily by instructing the system to "watch what I do;" scripts are stored as readable and editable PASCAL programs.The potential of such algorithm animation environments is great, but can be fully realized only if they are sufficiently easy and enjoyable to use. This dissertation is step towards achieving these goals. In it, we develop a model for creating real-time animations, as well as a framework for interacting with these animations. We also describe a prototype system, BALSA-II, and its feasibility study system, BALSA-I, that realize the conceptual model.},

We argue that such technology, no matter how well it is designed, is of little educational value unless it engages learners in an active learning activity. Drawing on a review of experimental studies of visualization effectiveness, we motivate this position against the backdrop of current attitudes and best practices with respect to visualization use. We suggest a new taxonomy of learner engagement with visualization technology. Grounded in Bloom's well-recognized taxonomy of understanding, we suggest metrics for assessing the learning outcomes to which such engagement may lead. Based on these taxonomies of engagement and effectiveness metrics, we present a framework for experimental studies of visualization effectiveness. Interested computer science educators are invited to collaborate with us by carrying out studies within this framework.},

	abstract = {Conversational programmers represent a class of learners who are not required to write any code, yet try to learn programming to improve their participation in technical conversations. We carried out interviews with 23 conversational programmers to better understand the challenges they face in technical conversations, what resources they choose to learn programming, how they perceive the learning process, and to what extent learning programming actually helps them. Among our key findings, we found that conversational programmers often did not know where to even begin the learning process and ended up using formal and informal learning resources that focus largely on programming syntax and logic. However, since the end goal of conversational programmers was not to build artifacts, modern learning resources usually failed these learners in their pursuits of improving their technical conversations. Our findings point to design opportunities in HCI to invent learner-centered approaches that address the needs of conversational programmers and help them establish common ground in technical conversations.},

	abstract = {Algorithm visualization (AV) technology graphically illustrates how algorithms work. Despite the intuitive appeal of the technology, it has failed to catch on in mainstream computer science education. Some have attributed this failure to the mixed results of experimental studies designed to substantiate AV technology's educational effectiveness. However, while several integrative reviews of AV technology have appeared, none has focused specifically on the software's effectiveness by analyzing this body of experimental studies as a whole. In order to better understand the effectiveness of AV technology, we present a systematic meta-study of 24 experimental studies. We pursue two separate analyses: an analysis ofindependent variables , in which we tie each study to a particular guiding learning theory in an attempt to determine which guiding theory has had the most predictive success; and an analysis of dependent variables, which enables us to determine which measurement techniques have been most sensitive to the learning benefits of AV technology. Our most significant finding is that how students use AV technology has a greater impact on effectiveness than what AV technology shows them. Based on our findings, we formulate an agenda for future research into AV effectiveness.},

This paper presents the results of a phenomenographic study designed to describe the different ways that teachers experience the use of an animation system as a pedagogical tool. The results suggest that increased acceptance of such tools by teachers depends on integrating the tools with other learning materials and on addressing the role of the teacher in the use of software by the students.},
