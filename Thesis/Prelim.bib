Vigorously taking issue with his approach, Fineman insists that because each of us is "inevitably dependent" at various stages in our lives, it makes much more sense for us to recognize from the outset that society has a vital role in providing assistance. Indeed, any individual carer's necessary reliance on outside resources makes this essential. Presenting her argument with conviction and eloquence, Fineman calls for the acceptance of collective and public responsibility for dependency, as well as a restructuring of the workplace consistent with a new understanding of the boundaries between private and public spheres. The Autonomy Myth demands a more responsive and active state to ensure that the burdens associated with dependency are more equitably distributed."--{BOOK} {JACKET.}},

Children become the workers and taxpayers of the next generation, and "investments" in them offer a significant payback to other participants in the economy. Yet parents, especially mothers, pay most of the costs. The high price of childrearing pushes many families into poverty, often with adverse consequences for children themselves. Parents spend time as well as money on children. Yet most estimates of the "cost" of children ignore the value of this time. Folbre provides a startlingly high but entirely credible estimate of the value of parental time per child by asking what it would cost to purchase a comparable substitute for it. She also emphasizes the need for better accounting of public expenditure on children over the life cycle and describes the need to rethink the very structure and logic of the welfare state. A new institutional structure could promote more cooperative, sustainable, and efficient commitments to the next generation.},

	abstract = {An urgent need to rethink sexual difference and equality has motivated some of the best recent feminist thought. Nowhere has this been more true than in the field of law, where feminist legal scholars have developed a widely read body of theory. Within law, the postmodern legal feminists have brought a unique perspective, making use of deconstructive strategies to expose contradictory and repressed elements within legal texts. In Postmodern Legal Feminism, Mary Joe Frug charts a course for future feminist thinking about law. She builds on advances made by earlier generations of legal theorists: the liberal feminists who stressed equality, the radical feminists who stressed male domination and sexuality, and the cultural feminists who stressed the positive virtues of traditional women's values. But at the same time she identifies the limitations of these earlier strands of legal feminism and demonstrates, through concrete analysis of legal doctrines, texts, and strategies, why postmodern feminism offers more hope for women. The book is unusual because it offers not simply a theoretical exposition but a series of demonstrations of the power of postmodern legal feminist analysis. It does so through a focus on specific examples of legal writing (the Dawson, Harvey and Henderson casebook; the {Posner/Rosenfeld} and Hillman articles), specific legal doctrines (the impossibility doctrine; the Sears case), and specific legal strategies (the impact of women in the legal profession; the antipornography campaign). It is also unusual in that it demonstrates the relevance of non-legal texts, such as Carol Gilligan's In a Different Voice, to law and the relevance of law to such basic social issues as the construction of the meaning of women's bodies.},

This book is both pessimistic and hopeful. With devastating thoroughness, the author shows how pervasive these patterns of relationship are in our work lives and personal lives, and how deep they run -- into the very language of the organization and of ordinary life. This is not a book about how women can succeed in business, but a criticism of books like those success manuals and notions like that idea of success. The author sees bureaucrats and clients as the 'second sex'. To fit in properly, they just learn the skills necessary to cope with subordinate status, skills that women have always learned as part of their 'femininity'. Liberal reforms -- placing more women in management positions, for example -- are not enough. What is required is the emergence of an alternative voice, one grounded in the experience and perceptions of women, that will challenge the patterns of control found in every aspect of modern life. Public discourse today is not the language of women even when women speak it. In this brilliant synthesis of the feminist literature and the literature on organizational theory and practice, the author suggests how a feminist discourse could interject into public debate a reformulation of the basic political questions of power, reason, and organization and thereby legitimate a concern of both autonomy and community. In the face of the massive incursions of bureaucracy into daily life, this is an important contribution to the project of human liberation."--Publisher description.},

Beginning with the modest assumption that feminism demands an examination of moral issues with a commitment to ending women's subordination, this anthology shows that one can no longer divide social issues into those that are feminist and those that are {not."Living} with Contradictions" does address many of the traditionally "feminist" issues. But it also includes issues not generally recognized as gendered, such as militarism, environmentalism, and the treatment of animals, demonstrating the value of a feminist perspective in these cases. And, far from reflecting any monolithic orthodoxy, the book shows that there is a rich diversity of views on many moral issues among those who share a feminist {commitment.Readers} can sample a varied selection of papers and essays from books, journals, newspapers, and grassroots newsletters. Covering a wide range of moral issues, this collection refuses to offer simple solutions, choosing instead to reflect the complexities and contradictions facing anyone attempting to live up to feminist ideals in a painfully pre-feminist {world.Based} on years of the editor's work in the field, imaginatively edited, and including generous introductions for students, this is the ideal text for introducing feminist perspectives into courses in ethics, social ethics, and public policy.},

	shorttitle = {The supportive state},
	abstract = {Broad agreement exists among politicians and policymakers that the family is a critical institution of American life. Yet the role that the state should play with respect to family ties among citizens remains deeply contested. This controversy over the state's role undergirds a broad range of public policy debates: Does the state have a responsibility to help resolve conflicts between work and family? Should same-sex marriage be permitted? Should parents who receive welfare benefits be required to work? Yet while these individual policy issues are endlessly debated, the underlying theoretical question of the stance that the state should take with families remains largely unexplored. In this book, the author argues that government must take an active role in supporting families. She contends that the respect for human dignity at the root of America's liberal democratic understanding of itself requires that the state not only support individual freedom and equality--the goods generally considered as grounds for state action in liberal accounts. It must also support families, because it is through families that the caretaking and human development needs which must be satisfied in any flourishing society are largely met. Families' capacity to satisfy these needs, she demonstrates, is critically affected by the framework of societal institutions in which they function. In the 'supportive state' model she develops, the state bears the responsibility for structuring societal institutions to support families in performing their caretaking and human development functions. Although not all family forms will further the important functions that warrant state support, she argues that a broad range will. Eichner's vigorous defense of the state's responsibility to enhance families' capacity for caretaking and human development stands as a sharp rejoinder to the widespread conservative belief that the state's role in family life must be diminished in order for families to flourish. -- from Publisher description},
