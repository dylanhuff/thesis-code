	abstract = {Algorithm visualization ({AV}) technology graphically illustrates how algorithms work. Despite the intuitive appeal of the technology, it has failed to catch on in mainstream computer science education. Some have attributed this failure to the mixed results of experimental studies designed to substantiate {AV} technology's educational effectiveness. However, while several integrative reviews of {AV} technology have appeared, none has focused specifically on the software's effectiveness by analyzing this body of experimental studies as a whole. In order to better understand the effectiveness of {AV} technology, we present a systematic meta-study of 24 experimental studies. We pursue two separate analyses: an analysis ofindependent variables , in which we tie each study to a particular guiding learning theory in an attempt to determine which guiding theory has had the most predictive success; and an analysis of dependent variables, which enables us to determine which measurement techniques have been most sensitive to the learning benefits of {AV} technology. Our most significant finding is that how students use {AV} technology has a greater impact on effectiveness than what {AV} technology shows them. Based on our findings, we formulate an agenda for future research into {AV} effectiveness.},

Constructing a new view for an algorithm typically takes dozens of design iterations, and can be very time-consuming. Our library eases the programmer's burden by providing high-level constructs for performing animations, and by offering an interpretive environment that eliminates the need for recompilations. This paper also illustrates {ANIM}3D's expressiveness by developing a 3D animation of Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm in just 70 lines of code.},

	title = {Algorithm Animation},
	abstract = {An algorithm animation environment is a means for exploring the dynamic behavior of algorithms that makes possible a fundamental improvement in the way we understand and think about them. It presents multiple graphical views of an algorithm in action, exposing properties that might otherwise be difficult to understand or even remain unnoticed. All views are updated simultaneously in real time as the algorithm executes, and each view is displayed in a separate window on the screen, whose location, size, and level of detail is interactively set by the end-user. A specialized interpreter controls execution in units that are specific to the algorithm, and allows multiple algorithms to be run simultaneously for comparisons. Programmers can implement new algorithms, graphical displays, and input generators and run them with existing libraries of such components.An important aspect of an algorithm animation environment, and one we believe is useful in any interactive environment, is the concept of a script: a record of an end-user's session that can be replayed. Scripts can be used both passively, as virtual videotapes, and actively, as an innovative communication medium: the viewer of a script can customize the videotape interactively, and can readily switch between passively viewing it and actively exploring its contents. Scripts are typically used as high-level macros, system tutors, and electronic textbooks and research notes. End-users can create scripts easily by instructing the system to "watch what I do;" scripts are stored as readable and editable {PASCAL} programs.The potential of such algorithm animation environments is great, but can be fully realized only if they are sufficiently easy and enjoyable to use. This dissertation is step towards achieving these goals. In it, we develop a model for creating real-time animations, as well as a framework for interacting with these animations. We also describe a prototype system, {BALSA}-{II}, and its feasibility study system, {BALSA}-I, that realize the conceptual model.},

	abstract = {Animation systems-software tools that can show a dynamic view of the execution of a program-were designed to help novices improve their understanding and to help teachers facilitate learning. Preliminary studies on the effectiveness of animation systems on the understanding of students have shown encouraging results. Nevertheless, the use of animation system is not very widespread. This paper presents the results of a phenomenographic study designed to describe the different ways that teachers experience the use of an animation system as a pedagogical tool. The results suggest that increased acceptance of such tools by teachers depends on integrating the tools with other learning materials and on addressing the role of the teacher in the use of software by the students.},
